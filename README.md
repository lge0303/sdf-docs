Welcome to the SLAC Shared Scientific Data Facility (S3DF). The S3DF
is a compute, storage and network architecture designed to support
massive scale analytics required by all SLAC experimental facilities
and programs, including LCLS/LCLS-II, UED, cryo-EM, the accelerator,
and the Rubin observatory. The S3DF infrastructure is optimized for
data analytics and is characterized by large, massive throughput, high
concurrency storage systems.

**December 29th 11:00am PST: S3DF and services are available. However, a few of the interactive nodes remain down as we still have to address some network issues related to them. Users will still be able to access interactive resources via the "iana" pool if facility-specific resources are unavailable. As always, please do continue to report issues via email to s3df-help@slac.stanford.edu**
